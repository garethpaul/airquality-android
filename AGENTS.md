# AGENTS.md

## Repository purpose

`garethpaul/airquality-android` is an Android application or sample. AirQuality App for Android

## Project structure

- `Makefile` - repository verification targets
- `scripts` - baseline checks and helper scripts
- `docs` - plans, notes, and generated README assets
- `app` - application source or app module
- `build.gradle` - Gradle build configuration
- `gradlew` - checked-in Gradle wrapper

## Development commands

- Install dependencies: no repository-specific install command is documented.
- Full baseline: `make check`
- Combined verification: `make verify`
- Lint/static checks: `make lint`
- Tests: `make test`
- Build: `make build`
- Android unit tests when the SDK is configured: `./gradlew test`
- Android debug build when the SDK is configured: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- If a command above skips because a platform toolchain is missing, verify on a machine with that SDK before claiming platform behavior is tested.

## Coding conventions

- Language mix noted in the README: Java (6).
- Use the checked-in Gradle wrapper for Android builds when an SDK is configured.

## Testing guidance

- Test-related files detected: `app/src/test/`
- Start with the narrowest relevant test or Make target, then run `make check` before handing off if the change is not documentation-only.
- Keep README verification notes in sync when commands, fixtures, or supported toolchains change.

## PR / change guidance

- Keep diffs focused on the requested repository and avoid unrelated modernization or formatting churn.
- Preserve public APIs, sample behavior, file formats, and documented environment variables unless the task explicitly changes them.
- Update tests, README notes, or docs/plans when behavior, security posture, or validation commands change.
- Call out skipped platform validation, legacy toolchain assumptions, and any risky files touched in the final summary.

## Safety and gotchas

- Detected references to Twitter. Keep API keys, OAuth credentials, tokens, and account-specific values in local configuration only.
- `AirQualityApplication` skips Fabric/Twitter initialization while checked-in credential placeholders are blank.
- `NetworkRequest.buildUrl` trims, validates, and URL-encodes latitude and longitude before constructing the backend request.
- `NetworkRequest.buildUrlFromParams` validates the `AsyncTask` parameter array before the background request path creates an HTTP request.
- `NetworkRequest` applies bounded connection and socket timeouts to the HTTP client used for the backend request.
- `MainActivity` treats missing or malformed `air_quality` JSON as an explicit unknown state before accelerometer rendering.

## Agent workflow

1. Inspect the README, Makefile, manifests, and the files directly related to the request.
2. Make the smallest source or docs change that satisfies the task; avoid generated, vendored, or local-environment files unless required.
3. Run the narrowest useful validation first, then `make check` or the documented package/platform gate when available.
4. If a required SDK, service credential, or external runtime is unavailable, record the skipped command and why.
5. Summarize changed files, commands run, and remaining risks or follow-up validation.
